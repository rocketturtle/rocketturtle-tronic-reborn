# About

After years of neglect, RocketTurtle's Tronic Remix resource pack is being reborn for Minecraft 1.14.4!

The rebirthing process is ongoing, but most of the v1.5 release from 2017 is functional again, including previoulsy unreleased content from the v1.6 that never was.  The goal is to bring Tronic Reborn to fully complete status, and keep it up to date in the future.

# How to Install

Open Minecraft, click on "Options", then "Resource Packs".  Choose "Open resource pack folder" and copy RocketTurtle's Tronic Reborn resource pack to that folder.  Go back to Minecraft, where the resource pack should now be listed; click on it to activate.

That's it!

# To Do

An unordered list of future features:

* Fix models for fences and fence gates
* Fix models for levers, hoppers, tripwire hooks
* Fix akward texture application for some stairs and slabs

* Rebuild texture for new horse models
* Retexture rabbits in higher definition
* Finish texturing parrots, illagers, and other 1.12 additions

* Texture Aquatic Update and Illage and Pillage additions
* Texture 1.15 snapshot additions (can't wait to texture bees!)
